      Hi, I'm Julie - a MSc student in Computational Sciences and Engineering at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. I am passionate about AI and its application to engineering challenges. Outside of academia, I love going on adventures, either on foot, skis or on a bicycle.

      My passion for the outdoors originally led me through a BSc in Environmental Sciences and Engineering at EPFL. I had the opportunity to spend my third and last year at ETHZ, which I used to perfect my german and explore classes related to the energy industry. Recognizing the growing importance of statistical and data analysis, I pursued a MSc in Computational Sciences and Engineering with the desire to develop rigorous mathematical modelling tools and to improve my programming skills.

      I had the chance to work on several fascinating projects during my master, as well as conducting an enriching internship. Please reach out if you want to discuss any of those subjects.
