      Hi, I'm Julie - a MSc student in Computational Sciences and Engineering at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. I primarly specialized in data science and deep learning, while maintaining a strong focus on the energy sector.

    <p>   
      With experience in geospatial and scientific deep learning, I am most interested in data-driven solutions to engineering challenges. Currently, I’m researching the use of Graph Transformers for end-to-end medium-range weather forecasting. Looking ahead, I’m eager to leverage my quantitative skills in energy markets and data consulting, where I can contribute to innovative, sustainable solutions.

      I had the chance to work on several fascinating projects during my master, as well as conducting an enriching internship. Please reach out if you want to discuss any of those subjects.
