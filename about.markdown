   Hi, I'm Julie - a MSc student in Computational Sciences and Engineering at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. I am passionate about the applications of data analysis and deep learning to challenges related to the environment and to the energy industry. Outside of academia, I love going on adventures, either on foot, skis or on a bicycle. 
</p>

<p>   
    My passion for the outdoors originally led me through a BSc in Environmental Sciences and Engineering at EPFL. I had the opportunity to spend my third and last year at ETHZ, which I used to perfect my german and explore classes related to the energy industry. I quickly realised my passion for the latter. Furthermore, I recognize the growing importance of statistical and data analysis. Following that realisation, I pursued a MSc in Computational Sciences and Engineering with the desire to develop rigorous mathematical modelling tools and to improve my programming skills. 
</p>

<p>   
    I had the chance to work on several fascinating projects during my master, as well as conducting a enriching internship. All can be found in the 'projects' section. Please reach out if you want to discuss any of those subjects.
